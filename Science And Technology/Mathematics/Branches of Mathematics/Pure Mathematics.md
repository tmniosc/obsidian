# Overview

**Pure Mathematics** is the branch of mathematics focused on **understanding mathematical concepts for their own sake**, rather than for direct application to the physical world or practical problems.

It seeks **truth, beauty, and logical structure** within mathematics itself — exploring abstract ideas, proving theorems, and building consistent systems of reasoning.
