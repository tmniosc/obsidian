# Overview
The **No Free Lunch (NFL) theorem** is a fundamental concept in machine learning and optimization that basically says:

> **No single algorithm works best for all possible problems.**

In other words, an algorithm that performs exceptionally well on one type of problem will necessarily perform worse on other types of problems if you consider all possible problems equally.

Here’s a more detailed breakdown:
## Origin

- Proposed by **David Wolpert and William Macready** in the 1990s.
- Initially formulated in the context of **optimization**, but extends naturally to **machine learning**.
## Statement (Simplified)

For any two algorithms A1​ and A2

Average performance of A1 over all possible problems = Average performance of A2

- There is **no universally superior algorithm**.
- Performance gains are only possible when the problem has **structure or patterns** that the algorithm can exploit
## Implications for Machine Learning

1. **No universal best model:**
	- For example, a CNN is great for images but may perform poorly on text or tabular data.

1. **Importance of inductive bias:**
	- Inductive bias is the assumptions a model makes about the data.
    - Choosing the right bias (architecture, regularization, feature design) is key.

2. **Need for domain knowledge:**
    - Tailoring models to the problem often beats “general-purpose” approaches.

## Intuition

Imagine trying to guess the next number in a sequence.

- If the sequence is always arithmetic, one method works.
- If it’s random, no method consistently works better than chance.
- **NFL theorem says:** when considering all sequences equally, no method is better than any other on average.
## Connection to Inductive Bias

- **[[Inductive Bias|Inductive bias]]** is the “prior assumptions” built into your algorithm.
- NFL theorem shows that **success comes from bias that matches the problem**, not from general algorithmic superiority.
