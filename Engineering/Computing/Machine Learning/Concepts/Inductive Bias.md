# Overview

> **Inductive bias** (or cognitive bias in AI context) is the set of **assumptions a learning model makes about the data**.  
> It allows the model to **generalize better from limited training data**, instead of learning everything from scratch.

In simple terms: **bias = prior knowledge or assumptions about the structure of the data**.

- Data is always limited → the model cannot learn everything
- Helps the model **focus on relevant structures**
- Improves **learning efficiency and generalization**

Examples:
- [[Convolution Neural Network]] assumes images have **locality** and **translation invariance**
- [[Recurrent Neural Network]] assumes sequences have **temporal order**
- [[Graph neural network]] assumes data has **graph structure** and **important local relations**
