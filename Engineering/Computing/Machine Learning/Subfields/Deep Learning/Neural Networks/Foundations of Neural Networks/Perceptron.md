# Overview

A perceptron is the simplest form of an artificial neural network, functioning as a binary classifier that assigns inputs to one of two categories. It works by multiplying inputs by weights, summing them up, and passing the result through a step function to produce a binary output (0 or 1). Originally developed by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957, the perceptron was a foundational concept in artificial intelligence, though its single-layer version is limited to solving problems that are linearly separable
