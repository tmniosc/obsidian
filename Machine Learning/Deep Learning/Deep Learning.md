# Overview

**Deep Learning (DL)** is a subfield of **Machine Learning (ML)** that uses **artificial neural networks with many layers** to automatically learn complex representations from large amounts of data.

> “Deep Learning learns directly from raw data — images, text, sound — without needing humans to design features.”

Example:

- Instead of manually defining “edge” or “color” features for an image, a _Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)_ learns them automatically from pixels.

At its core, Deep Learning is built around **[[Neural Networks]] (NNs)** — computational models inspired by how the brain works.
