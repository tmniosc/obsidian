# Overview

**Category Theory** is a branch of **mathematics** that studies **structures** and the **relationships between them** in a very general and abstract way.  
It provides a _unifying language_ for almost all areas of mathematics — algebra, topology, logic, computer science, and more.

Instead of focusing on what mathematical objects _are_ (like numbers, sets, or groups), **category theory** focuses on **how they relate** to each other through **mappings** called _morphisms_ (or _arrows_).

> You can think of it as “mathematics of structure and connection.”
