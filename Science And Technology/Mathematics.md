# Overview
# What is mathematics?

- Mathematics is the study of **patterns, structures, quantities, and relationships**—a language and framework for understanding how things relate, change, and combine in the world around us.

It’s both a **tool** and a **way of thinking**:

- As a **tool**, it helps us model and solve real-world problems — from predicting the weather to encrypting data or designing circuits.
- As a **way of thinking**, it trains us to reason logically, see connections, and think abstractly.

Here’s how it’s often broken down:

At its core, mathematics is about **seeking patterns and proving truths** rigorously.  
It can be **pure** (done for its own sake, like exploring symmetry or infinity) or **applied** (used in science, engineering, economics, etc.).
